# React Native Pokedex 📱

This repository contains the code built while following the **[React Native for Dummies 2026 – Full Beginner Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUXnASp_WyQ)** tutorial by **Code with Beto**.

I created this project to familiarize myself with the latest React Native ecosystem and brush up on mobile development skills using Expo.

- **Dynamic UI:** Displays a list of Pokemon with images and background colors dynamically rendered based on the Pokemon's element type.

- **State Management:** Uses React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) for data fetching.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React Native (via [Expo](https://expo.dev/))
- **Language:** TypeScript / JavaScript
- **Routing:** Expo Router
- **Data Source:** PokeAPI
